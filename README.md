Automated E-Learning Material Generator (Under Google Build and Blog Marathon Hyderabad)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses Google Cloud technologies to generate personalized e-learning content for courses. By leveraging Vertex AI (Gemini model), the project generates summaries and educational materials, which are then stored in a Cloud Spanner database for easy retrieval. The backend is deployed on Cloud Run for scalability, using Flask to handle API requests. This solution enables dynamic content generation for educational platforms, making it easier to create tailored course material.
